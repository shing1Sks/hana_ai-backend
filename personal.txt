context : i wrote this before while learning ml to make myself more confident and a fun side project.It was when my society asked someone to volunteer and i see this as a good oppurtunity.
This article is like a basic intro to ml with some non tech referencea and then a simple project.

üöÄ Just wrapped up an amazing experience at the Codecubicles @ 15-05-2024 hackathon! üôå It was my first online hackathon, and I can't emphasize enough how much I learned about collaboration and communication and presentation. These skills will be incredibly valuable in my future projects.
Our team which included myself, Vaibhav Deep Srivastava and Saujanya worked on a Financial Guidance app, aiming to empower individuals with financial skills using AI-based analysis and visual analytics. We also offered access to professional financial advisors to cover what AI couldn't. Although we didn't make it to the final round, the journey was truly enriching.
One of my key takeaways was the importance of time management. Despite not creating a working demo, I believe the experience was totally worth it. Looking forward to applying these learnings in future endeavors! ‚ú®üíº hashtag#Codecubicles hashtag#Hackathon hashtag#FinancialGuidance hashtag#AI hashtag#LearningExperience hashtag#TimeManagement
