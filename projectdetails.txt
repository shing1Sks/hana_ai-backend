Projects


Aifybox | Flask, Tensorﬂow, Python, Javascript, HTML, CSS, HuggingFace
• Developed [Aifybox Chrome extension] [Demo], integrating a home-brewed LSTM+GRU model to provide AI-driven
text autocompletion and suggestions in text ﬁelds.
• Trained and optimized the deep learning model, enabling real-time, space-triggered word prediction with OOV
(out-of-vocabulary) handling for enhanced user experience. [Model Training Notebook]
• Deployed the model on Hugging Face Spaces, allowing seamless backend integration via REST APIs for scalable and
efficient predictions.
• Implemented intuitive Chrome extension behavior, activating only on user input to ensure non-intrusive,
contextually accurate text suggestions.
Development journey well this was my first time building a chrome extension. It was pretty cool. Learnt a lot of new things. But the model side was whole other thing i had to wait for hours to see a model train and then if i found an issue or mistake i had to start all over again . Fun experiance overall and i learnt a lot. First time ever training a dl model.Overall went great.Not satisfied with the results of the final model so hopefully would work on that. Not yet published the extension because not satisfied with the performance but still a great experiance and it has a lot of scope for future still.Overall a great idea and building journey i would say.

Monkey Score | Scikit-learn, ﬂask, Nextjs, Vercel
• Developed a machine learning software [MonkeyScore] to predict scores and provide personalized analysis based on
individual traits and characteristics.
• Leveraged various machine learning models and techniques, including synthetic data generation and self-collected
data, to ensure accurate predictions.
• Designed and implemented both the frontend and backend of the application for seamless user interaction and data
processing.
Development journey overall fun i encountered a lot of challenges which helped me learn a bunch i mena i dont think you can better idea about ml than tryning to build an ambitious ml project. First issue was no existing dataset so i had to focus on data collection which brings to my second issue awfull success in data collection after trying my best i could collect a measely 40 50 rows of data. But still didnt gave up tried out a bunch of stuff and also explored synthetic data and learnt a lot but the data setion i couldnt do much.I then tried a bunch of models like decision tree based model like random forest , regressors , xg boost and such but i learnt it was not a great choice for my condition therefore went to simple polynomial linear regression still not the best but a lot better.Overall got a lot better idea bout value of each types of models and stuff and a whole other bunch.So much i learnt therefore i compiled my learning into an article : https://www.linkedin.com/posts/shreyash-shing1_%F0%9D%97%9C-%F0%9D%97%B0%F0%9D%97%BC%F0%9D%97%BA%F0%9D%97%BD%F0%9D%97%B6%F0%9D%97%B9%F0%9D%97%B2%F0%9D%97%B1-%F0%9D%97%AE%F0%9D%97%B9%F0%9D%97%B9-%F0%9D%97%BA%F0%9D%98%86-%F0%9D%97%B9%F0%9D%97%B2%F0%9D%97%AE%F0%9D%97%BF%F0%9D%97%BB%F0%9D%97%B6%F0%9D%97%BB%F0%9D%97%B4%F0%9D%98%80-activity-7278059760682184704-eQP_?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAEWU0jEB31EV6EHh-_wkfFfPUD0fddghkDc

I was highly inspired and excited to create my own project after completing the backend series at Chai aur Code by Hitesh sir. I can fully vouch for it as the best course to go for! Not just the backend series, but all the courses by Hitesh sir are top-notch and have been the primary source of my knowledge for most of my tech stack. 🙏
op-db is a prewritten backend code designed with various use cases in mind, perfect for individual projects! 🎉
The op-db package streamlines database setup into a few simple steps, creating a versatile server that can be fully customized and, once hosted, serves most of your project needs for all your projects. With its innovative project segregation system, op-db allows you to reuse the same API endpoints across multiple projects, making it an ideal choice for hackathons and small-scale projects.
